Code of Conduct for Group Submission

Purpose

The Code of Conduct establishes a framework for collaboration, accountability, and mutual respect among group members engaged in coursework. It aims to ensure that all team members can contribute effectively and are assessed fairly based on their participation and contributions.

Principles of Conduct

1. Respect and Inclusion

- Treat all team members with respect, valuing diverse perspectives and backgrounds.

- Encourage open communication and active participation from all group members.

2. Collaboration and Teamwork

- Work collaboratively to achieve common goals, recognizing that the success of the group depends on the contributions of all members.

- Foster a supportive environment where team members feel comfortable sharing ideas and feedback.

3. Responsibility and Accountability

- Each member is responsible for their individual contributions and attendance at meetings.

- Maintain transparency regarding workload and progress, documenting contributions in the agreed spreadsheet at each assessment point.

4. Punctuality and Preparedness

- Attend all scheduled meetings, including code reviews, on time and fully prepared.

- Ensure that all necessary tools and resources are ready prior to meetings.

5. Conflict Resolution

- Address conflicts or disagreements within the team constructively and professionally.

- If consensus cannot be reached, seek guidance from a member of the teaching team.

Submission and Assessment Procedures

1. Individual Contributions

- Complete the contributions spreadsheet collectively, ensuring accuracy and agreement on each member's percentage contributions.

- Be prepared to discuss and defend the contributions if discrepancies arise.

2. Code Review Meetings

- Attend all code review meetings. Attendance will be monitored and is critical for individual assessment.

- Arrive on time, and be ready to present project status, contributions, and any blockers.

3. Reporting Misconduct

- If a team member feels that the conduct of another member is detrimental to the group's performance, they should raise the issue during the next team meeting or privately with a teaching team member.

Disciplinary Procedures

1. Grounds for Dismissal

- A member may be dismissed from the team for repeated breaches of the Code of Conduct, including non-participation, failure to meet deadlines, or disrespectful behaviour.

2. Process

- Evidence of misconduct must be presented at the next team meeting.

- The accused member can provide mitigating circumstances.

- The teaching team will make the final decision regarding dismissal.

3. Appeal

- Any dismissed member may appeal the decision within one week by providing suitable evidence to the module team.

Code Review Guidelines

1. Preparation

- Ensure that all project elements (e.g., GitHub setup, Dockerfile, GitFlow branches) are in place prior to the first code review.

- Use metrics from GitHub to assess individual contributions and overall project health.

2. Grading and Feedback

- Late arrivals or lack of readiness will result in a capped grade for the code review.

- Constructive feedback should be provided to foster improvement and growth.

By adhering to this Code of Conduct, we can create a productive and respectful environment that enhances our learning experience and contributes to the successful completion of our coursework.
